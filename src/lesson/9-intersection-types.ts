/*

? Intersection Types

* In TypeScript, an intersection type (TypeA & TypeB) is a way of combining multiple types into one.

* This means that an object of an intersection type will have all the properties of TypeA and all the properties of TypeB.

* It's a way of creating a new type that merges the properties of existing types.
