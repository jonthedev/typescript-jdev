/*

* Define the Person and Student types. Student should have a study method and Person should have a login method.

* Create a function named isStudent that takes a parameter person of type Person.

* In the function signature, specify a return type that is a type predicate: person is Student.

* In the function body, use a type assertion to treat person as a Student, and check if the study - method is not undefined.

* This will return true if person is a Student, and false otherwise.

* Use the isStudent function in an if statement with person as the argument.

* In the if block (where isStudent(person) is true), call the study method on person. TypeScript knows that person is a Student in this block, so this is safe.

* In the else block (where isStudent(person) is false), call the login method on person. This is safe because if person is not a Student, it must be a Person, and all Person objects have a login method.
