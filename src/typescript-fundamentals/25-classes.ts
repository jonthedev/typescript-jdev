? Classes

* Classes in JavaScript are a blueprint for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to manipulate that data.

* Classes in JavaScript support inheritance and can be used to create more complex data structures.

* A constructor in a class is a special method that gets called when you create a new instance of the class. It's often used to set the initial state of the object.
